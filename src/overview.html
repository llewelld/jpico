<p /><h2>Summary</h2>

<p />This manual documents the jpico library internal classes and methods. The jpico library can be used in any Java implementation of Pico or a Pico service. Its main use is currently in providing functionality for <a href="../android-pico">android-pico</a>, the Pico app for Android, which allows users to authenticate to Pico-enabled services.

<p />This documentation provides technical details of all the code implemented in the jpico library. It's unlikely to be very useful for end users though.

<p />Although jpico is a dependency of android-pico, the android-pico git repository has it configured as a submodule. Therefore, if you're just interested in building android-pico, you don't need to follow these instructions, you can just follow the instructions in the <a href="../android-pico">android-pico documentation</a>.

<p /><h2>Documentation structure</h2>

<p />The jpico code is split into Java packages, each of which encapsulates a particular type of functionality. Each package has the prefix <code>org.mypico.jpico</code>.

<p />Inside each package you'll find different classes, each implementing more specific functionality. Click on one of the package names above or in the side-panel to filter its contents. Then click on one of the interfaces, exceptions, classes, etc. in the side-panel below it to find out more about it.

<p /><h2>Building from source on Linux</h2>

<p />You can build jpico on Windows, Linux, or any other platform with a JKD. Here we give details for how to build it on a Linux machine; building on Windows should be similar.

<p />To build jpico you'll need to install a JDK, and and a few other dependencies:

<ul>
<li />git
<li />ant
<li />libhamcrest-java
<li />libemma-java
</ul>

On Ubuntu 16.04, you can get these all in one go using the following command.

<pre class="fragment">
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk git ant libhamcrest-java libemma-java
</pre>

<p />Now ensure you've downloaded the latest version of the code from the git repository and are inside the project folder.

<pre class="fragment">
git clone git@github.com:mypico/jpico.git
cd jpico
</pre>

<p />You can then build jpico at the command line using the following commands.

<pre class="fragment">
export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dfile.encoding=UTF8
ant compileTest dist
</pre>

<p />This will leave an jar archive at <code>dist/lib/JPico.jar</code>. You can also build the documentation using the following command, which will leave the documentation in the <code>docs</code> directory.

<pre class="fragment">
javadoc -overview src/overview.html org.mypico.jpico -subpackages org.mypico.jpico -classpath src -package -stylesheetfile assets/stylesheet.css -d docs/javadoc;
</pre>

If you're using jpico with android-pico, it's already included as a submodule of android-pico and will be built automatically when you build android-pico.
